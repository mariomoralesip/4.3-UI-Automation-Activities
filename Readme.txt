How are the activities used?

You can find the UI automation activities in the Activity panel of StudioX, in the App/Web Automation category. The specific resource, as mentioned above, is Use App/Browser, which will tell the robot which UI is the object of the automation project.

What should I pay attention to when using the UI automation activities?

When using UI automation activities, you should be aware of the type of activity and, in the case of input activities, the input modes.

Instead of the Double UI App, we'll use the Demo UI, very similar to what you're used to. The difference is that the UI Demo requires authentication. So, in this demo, you will also learn how to automate a login process.

In developing the automation you'll use the following input files, websites, and applications:

The UI Demo App - this is the dummy bank teller app we'll be using to get the transaction numbers.
UI Automation - Input File - this is the spreadsheet we'll be working with, containing information about the transactions and needing to be filled with the transactions' numbers.
